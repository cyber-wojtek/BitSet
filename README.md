# BitSet Classes for C, C++ and Python

This project offers BitSet Classes implemented in C, C++, and Python with a focus on efficiency.

**Note:** The primary goal of this project is to maximize performance, prioritizing efficiency over user-friendliness. Data members are intentionally not set as private/protected to maintain efficiency, and this approach will remain consistent throughout the project.
